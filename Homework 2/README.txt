These programs add new functionalities to existing classes in Java API.


The improvedST is the extension to the StringTokenizer class adding new functionalities.

The ImprovedRandom is the extension to the Random class adding new functionalities.


The clientClass.java has the main method.

To test the new functionality of ImprovedRandom, you need to make changes to the parameters of randomInRange(int, int) method accordingly.

To test the new functionality of improvedST, you need to make changes to the String 'l' accordingly. You can also initiate the 'ist' object with different (more than one) parameters like you would to initate StringTokenizer differently.

For this to work properly, you need to compile 'ImprovedRandom.java', 'improvedST.java' and 'intExtension.java' first and then compile 'clientClass.java'. Then you can run the program!
