To start using this program, follow the steps mentioned below in order:

STEP 1: Compiling
All the Classes are in the same package
Compile the Classes in the following order:

1) Thing.java
2) Creature.java
3) Flyer.java
4) Tiger.java
5) Ant.java
6) Bat.java
7) Fly.java
8) TestCreature.java

STEP 2: Run the program
The TestCreature.java is the Client class with the main method, so run it.
While running the code, you will be prompted accordingly and the program is user friendly.
Make sure that you use the exact Options as indicated in the program. Capitalization matters!!

POST SCRIPT:
The total numbers of things has been limited to 5 and the total creatures to 2.
It is because we were required to keep their variables 'final int'.
If you want to add more, just change thing_count and creature_count accordingly.
However, make sure that creature_count <= thing_count
